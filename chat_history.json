[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Build an app for car reviews"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will create a plan for building a car review app using React Native and Expo.\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen displaying a curated list of car reviews. Each review should show the car's image, model, and a brief summary.\n-   **Review Details Screen:** A dedicated screen for each car review, accessible by tapping on a review item on the home screen. This screen will display detailed information about the car, including specifications, pros and cons, user ratings, and a comprehensive review text.\n-   **Search Functionality:** Implement a search bar on the home screen to allow users to quickly find reviews for specific car models or brands.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for primary text)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2962FF` (Blue for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#64B5F6` (Light blue for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#FFAB40` (Orange for highlights)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for card backgrounds)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD54F` (Yellow for important highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify the Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):**\n    *   Update the `HomeScreen` component to fetch and display car review data. For now, this data can be hardcoded as a placeholder.\n    *   Implement the search bar functionality.\n    *   Create a `CarReviewItem` component to display each car review in a visually appealing card format.\n    *   Link each `CarReviewItem` to a `ReviewDetailsScreen` (which we'll create in the next step).\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's not relevant to the car review app.\n2.  **Create a Review Details Screen (`app/review/[id].tsx`):**\n    *   Create a new file `app/review/[id].tsx` to house the `ReviewDetailsScreen` component.\n    *   This screen should fetch and display the detailed information for a specific car review based on the `id` parameter in the route.\n    *   Include sections for specifications, pros and cons, user ratings, and the full review text.\n3.  **Update Navigation:**\n    *   Ensure seamless navigation between the `HomeScreen` and the `ReviewDetailsScreen`.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After the implementation, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T08:29:21.594599"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a car review app for React Native + Expo 54.
